                Early Developments:


                Ancient Civilizations:
                The study of linear equations, particularly systems of them, emerged early in the history of mathematics.<br>
                Babylonians (around 1800 BC) and the Chinese (around 200 BC) developed methods for solving such systems. <br>

                Determinants:
                Gottfried Leibniz is credited with introducing the notion of a determinant in 1693, a concept crucial for solving<br>
                systems of linear equations. 

                Cramer's Rule:
                Gabriel Cramer, in 1750, used determinants to solve systems of equations, leading to the development of Cramer's Rule. 
                Matrices and Vectors:

                The term "matrix" was introduced by James Joseph Sylvester in 1848, while the concept of vectors, a fundamental part<br>
                of linear algebra, was developed by Hermann Grassmann in his "Theory of Extension" published in 1844.</h3>
