                 FORMULAS:

                 1. Linear Equations:
                 Slope-Intercept Form: y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope <br>
                 and 'b' is the y-intercept.<br> 
                 Point-Slope Form: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where 'm' is the slope<br>
                  and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.<br> 
                 Standard Form: Ax + By = C.<br> 

                 2. Matrix Operations:
                 Matrix Addition: C = A + B, where cij = aij + bij.<br>
                 Matrix Multiplication: C = AB, where cij = Σ(aik * bkj) for k from 1 to n.<br>
                 Matrix Transpose: A^T is obtained by swapping rows and columns of A.<br>
                 Matrix Inverse: A^(-1) is the inverse of A such that AA^(-1) = I (identity matrix).<br> 

                 3. Vector Operations:
                 Dot Product: u · v = |u||v|cos(θ), where θ is the angle between u and v.<br>
                 Cross Product: u x v = |u||v|sin(θ)n, where θ is the angle between u and v,<br>
                  and n is a unit vector perpendicular to both u and v.<br>

                 4. Determinants:
                 |A| represents the determinant of matrix A.<br>
                 Properties: |A^T| = |A|, |AB| = |A||B|, |A^n| = (|A|)^n, |kA| = k^n|A| (for an n x n matrix A).<br> 

                 5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:
                 Eigenvalues are special scalars associated with a linear transformation that,<br>
                 when multiplied by a vector (eigenvector), result in the same vector scaled by that eigenvalue.<br>
                 The characteristic equation for finding eigenvalues is det(A - λI) = 0,<br>
                 where A is the matrix, λ is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.<br>
