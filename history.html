    <div class="History of linear algebra">
        <pre class="fontstyle">
            <h3>           The history of linear algebra can be traced back to the Babylonians who, around 1800 BC, were known to solve systems of<br>
            linear equations. Later, in the 16th century, Cardan developed a simple rule for solving systems of two linear equations with <br>
            two unknowns. The 17th century saw significant advancements, including the development of determinants by Leibnitz and the use of<br>
            matrices by Lagrange in his work on optimization problems. Between 1800 and 1900, there were further crucial developments, <br>
            including the work of Cauchy on determinants, eigenvalues, and matrix diagonalization, and the introduction of vector concepts<br>
            by Grassmann. The term "matrix" was first used by J. Sylvester. By the 20th century, linear algebra was established as a core<br>
            subject in university curricula, particularly in the 1940s at American universities, and is now widely taught in undergraduate <br>
            programs globally.

            Linear algebra has a rich history, with its roots emerging from the study of systems of linear equations and determinants.<br>
            Early developments in the 17th and 18th centuries focused on solving equations using determinants, and the concept of a matrix<br>
            emerged implicitly in the work of Lagrange. The 19th century saw significant advancements, including the development of vector <br>
            spaces, matrix theory, and eigenvalue analysis.
